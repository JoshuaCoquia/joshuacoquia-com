# Everything is a Skill - How to Improve at Anything

Chances are, you’ve encountered _something_ that amazed you.

You watched that stranger pull off that impossible task. A great speaker told you something that changed your perspective on life. A peer flexed the physique they earned after countless hours in the gym.

What if I said you could learn to do that? You _can_ learn skills that leave an impression on others, similar to how someone else performs a skill that leaves an impression on you. All you need to learn these skills is a growth mindset and a way to discover new information.

## Part 1: Everything is a Skill

When I showed others I could solve a Rubik’s Cube, many people would say they could never solve it themselves. I once tried to say they could learn to solve it themselves, as I also did not know how to previously. But many people would tell me they could never learn to solve it, and I gave up trying to say they could. They likely thought I was just a talented genius. But I knew all I did was learn the skill.

What impressed you was likely a skill or the result of one. Getting fit, although not a skill in itself, comes from regular exercise and dieting specifically to get fit, both of which you can learn. Speaking is a skill you can learn. Solving a Rubik’s Cube is a skill you can learn. The way you perceive these things is essential. If you view these as learnable skills, it will be easy to learn them. But if you believe you cannot learn, that will become challenging. You _are_ capable of learning. All you need to do is view the things in your life as skills you can improve on.

You may have heard of an idea called the _growth mindset_. This idea describes how your skills are not hopelessly unchangeable; you can develop them. You want to believe you can improve instead of being unable to change who you are. You want to know that you can upgrade who you are. You can overcome any challenges in your path. Learning that skill is just another challenge. You can conquer that. After all, mastering skills is simple with the variety of resources you can access on the internet today.

## Part 2: How to Improve at Anything

To improve, you need to practice a skill using the resources you discover. The internet is a fantastic resource for learning any skill you can think of. It holds an abundance of information. When you know how to search the internet, you can discover new skills and ways to improve them.

You can also look for sources in real life. If there is a book on the skill you want to learn, try reading it. If you know someone ahead of you in the skill you want to improve, ask them for advice and critiques. Although the internet holds many great resources, you may find sources you prefer in real life. Pick the resources you will benefit from the most.

There are many trustworthy sources, but also be aware of false information. There is a cliche that states, “If something is too good to be true, it probably is.” Learning a skill will require a baseline amount of _effort_, especially physically or mentally. Learning to become rich requires more effort than just buying a course. You need to put effort into giving value to others in exchange for money. After finding trustworthy sources, start working towards improving yourself in the craft.

Take action. Find resources. Make progress. Dedicate time to developing the skill, and you will improve.

## Conclusion

There is an extensive amount of things you can learn in the world. Many things you don’t realize are skills. When you learn to look for skills, you can master many things you may have overlooked previously. Look for skills you’re interested in, especially in places you may not expect them, and you’ll find ways to improve your life. Have a wonderful day!
