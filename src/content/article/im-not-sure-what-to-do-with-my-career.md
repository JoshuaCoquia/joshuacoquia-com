# I'm not sure what to do with my career

_Written by Joshua Coquia, Edited by Gurmukh Singh_

...

In my youth, I had one clear thing I wanted to do: I wanted to make stuff.

As I’ve grown up, I’ve realized that there are more and more options.

I’ve tried web development, software development, copywriting… The list goes on and on…

It’s tough. There are so many options. I’m not sure how to feel about that. It’s so cool that humans can be highly specialized. On the other hand, I feel like I won’t have many transferable skills if I want a career change.

I know soft skills exist–communication, leadership, problem-solving, etc. I just don’t expect to get to where I want to be with soft skills alone.

Where do I want to be?

In all honesty, I’m not sure. I want to have financial freedom. I want to go anywhere I want, at any time, not worrying about money or schedules. Beyond that, I’m not sure.

I was previously determined to go into the tech field. I wanted to pursue a computer science degree. I chose to take a computer science class to further explore the topic.

Now, I’m not sure.

I understand why I chose art for the two years of required VAPA classes at my school. Design is extremely cool to learn.

I don’t know 100% though. I’m starting to find theater and choir interesting for their social/presentational components.

I think my career will relate to computers. Whether that be websites, email, software, or anything else, I’m not sure.

I wanna learn more. I’m not sure where to look though.

I also miss the way I thought a few years ago. Confident I would do this one thing. Confident I needed this one degree.

I want to find direction. That’s why I’m writing this. I wanna explore my mind and try out writing at the same time.

I remember back in 7th grade I was in a creative writing class. At the beginning of each class, we would write based on a given writing prompt.

The prompt was always wacky and forced us to think creatively. It was a fun class looking back.

Now though, I’m left with many, many different paths.

I don’t know where to go.

I know significantly more about web development than I did a year ago. Two years ago, I knew even less.

Then, web development led me to web design.

Why?

I felt unable to design a website. I would put a lot of tech into developing the site, but the final product would look bland.

I started to go down a rabbit hole in web design.

At the same time, I started to dive deep into side hustles and growing my wealth.

It’s not that I’d consider myself someone who needs money.

I just want to know that I can get money and that one day, I can achieve freedom with money.

I want to go somewhere and spend money without worrying about future bills I have to pay.

I want to pay for my living without living paycheck to paycheck.

I want to go through life knowing that I’ve got total freedom.

I don’t know what path to take.

The way that I’m going through right now is a very traditional path. Go to high school. Get good grades. Impress colleges. Go to the best college you can. Get the degree. Get a well-paying job. Climb the corporate ladder. Retire one day, and live with the retirement.

I’m not too sure if I wanna commit to this path. On the one hand, it’s worked for my parents and my school recommends it.

On the other hand, I’ve been hearing things online.

Will getting a corporate job pay for the life I want?

I’ve somewhat considered starting a business. It’s weird though. There are business majors in college, but do I need a degree for that?

Also, more recently, I’ve been consuming online content recommending the idea of “side hustles” to me. Why not make some money in addition to a job?

I don’t know. Do I want to deal with the logistics of running a business? Not really. Do I want to deal with spending four years getting a degree and committing to a job I may not enjoy? Also not really.

I hope to find more direction in my future. It’s great having all of these options, but I don’t know what I can do.
