# What I Learned from Solving the Rubik's Cube 10,000 Times

I have solved my Rubik’s Cube over 10,000 times over the past several months. In this blog post, I’ll describe the journey from learning to solve the Rubik's Cube for the first time to improving at speedcubing.

## Solving the Rubik’s Cube for the First Time isn’t easy, but it isn’t impossible.

At first, solving the Rubik’s Cube seems impossible. Many assume they would never be able to solve it. People who don’t know how to solve the Rubik’s Cube think you need to be a genius to solve it. There is no magical trick or easy way to solve the Rubik’s Cube, but it is still possible to learn how to solve it.

Learning a beginner's method like the Layer-by-Layer (LBL) method can make solving the Rubik’s Cube understandable. The LBL method turns the solving process into several simple steps. Using online tutorials to learn a beginner’s method will make solving the Rubik’s Cube comprehensible.

## Becoming faster is much easier to comprehend.

The next step after learning the beginner’s method is learning to get faster. Unlike learning to solve for the first time, the path to being a faster speedcuber is simple. There are many methods beyond the LBL method, with the three most popular being CFOP, ROUX, and ZZ. While learning a solving method, there are many small yet significant concepts to know about. Learning finger tricks improves speed by reducing regrips. Memorizing algorithms and minimizing thinking during execution are essential for lowering move count and maximizing speed. Developing the skill of look-ahead after mastering algorithms reduces pauses. These general concepts will help you improve along with learning a speedsolving method.

## Participate in the community.

The speedcubing community is vibrant and supportive. Many people will congratulate you if you tell them you hit a new personal best or a good solve. Competing in speedcubing competitions is a fun experience. These competitions provide a place to connect with others. The environment is chill and laid-back. Even though these are called “competitions,” many people go to meet people to talk about speedcubing. It’s more like a hangout than a competition for many people.

## Conclusion

Learning how to solve the Rubik’s Cube and getting faster is a fun, challenging journey. Accessing resources on the internet to learn speedsolving is a great way to get better at this hobby. Speedcubing is just one of many skills you can learn on the internet; There are many other skills you can learn online. Use the internet to improve your skills.
