I previously thought that solving the Rubik's Cube was an impossible feat. I knew nothing about the Rubik’s Cube, and I could not figure out how to solve it with any amount of logic, intuition, or pure skill I possessed. I had my cube, and before I knew it, it was scrambled. I quickly gave up on any attempts to solve it. The cube was still a fun toy, but I thought I would never see it in its original state. Several years later, my perspective was changed when I learned to solve it for the first time.

In late September 2022, I received a Rubik’s Cube as an early birthday present, and I could not solve it… yet. I spent hours trying to learn how to solve it for the first time. I began by watching a tutorial on YouTube. It was easy to understand. It was not as easy to execute. Before I knew it, after a few hours spread over a few days, I solved the whole Rubik’s Cube for the first time. I proudly told my friends online. In a few minutes, I ended up messing up the cube. This time, it only took me about thirty minutes to fix it back. This was only the start of my journey through speedcubing.

My first recorded time for a solve was `3:01.87`. My _twelfth_ solve. During a break in class, I had my cube out. Someone asked me if I could solve the cube. I don’t remember who scrambled it, but I remembered solving it. Another day though, another cuber asked to solve my cube. After a bit of time, I reluctantly gave them my cube. With the cube in their hands, they looked _so_ fast. Before I knew it, the first two layers were done, the top side was yellow, and edge pieces were swapped across from each other. For as long as they paused, I thought they messed up the solve attempt, and that would be that. Nope. After the pause, they solved the rest in... maybe one second. They gave me my cube and walked away. I was amazed. Seeing this gave me an end goal to reach: become extremely fast.

I kept solving and solving, and my times got lower and lower. `2:30.90`. `2:04.14`. `1:58.43` on my 30th attempt. At this time, I was manually writing each attempt and the time it took. By my 100th solve on October 15th, 2022, I started to learn speed-solving strategies. Before then, I used the LBL (Layer by Layer) method. I intended to transition into the CFOP method. My first step was to learn the F in CFOP: F2L, or First 2 Layers. It took me about 100 solves before I felt comfortable with that. I then learned the O and P: OLL, Orientation of the Last Layer, and PLL, Permutation of the Last Layer. Full OLL required learning 57 cases, while full PLL required 21 cases. I wasn’t learning 78 cases. The beginner versions of this method required 10 cases and 6 cases. The downside… They took two looks (pauses), while the full versions only required one. Using 16 cases in exchange for four total pauses was better for me at the time. My sub-1 minute came after I bought a proper speedcube: The _MoYu WeiLong WR M 2021 Maglev 3x3_. My sub-30 happened in late November. I broke the sub-20 barrier with a Gan 13 M Maglev UV 3x3 on January 2nd, 2023. In the same month, I went to my first official cubing competition.

Cubing in a competitive environment was different from cubing anywhere else. There was more pressure. I wanted to reach the second round in 3x3. I barely missed it. I was still happy with my results. After choking my first solve with a time of `39.09`, I finished my Ao5 (average of 5) with a time of `24.84`. The Ao5 in cubing is calculated by removing the best and worst times of five solve attempts and getting the mean of the remaining three. My times were `(39.09) 21.93 26.35 21.23 (26.24)`.That was average for me. I continued to improve from there.

Now, as of writing this, I could tell people that I would be able to solve a cube in about 20 seconds after being given 15 seconds to look at the cube. I learned all 21 PLL cases, most OLL cases, and advanced F2L. I've shown off my cubing skills to many people. Spamming algorithms and doing solves became normal. Learning to solve the Rubik’s Cube was not about becoming a genius; learning to solve was about following guides and practicing.
